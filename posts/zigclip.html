        Released
        <a href="https://github.com/Aryvyo/zigClipboard">zigClipboard</a>
        today<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        This was the first thing I ever wrote in Zig, and it was quite a fun
        learning experience!<br />
        <br />
        At first I was on an older nixpkgs channel so I was using zig 0.12.0, so
        I had basically 0 completions from the LSP LOL!<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        After I fixed that tho it was pretty smooth sailing.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Learning about how the X server handles selections was super cool, I
        even went on a side tangent studying about Unix domain sockets, though I
        didn’t end up using them.<br />
        <br />
        I wanted to have some way to track the items in my clipboard, but I
        didn’t really wanna disrupt the flow I’d gotten used to with linux,
        where if I close an app, I lose my clipboard, though it's probably more
        QoL than anything, I didn’t want to mess with that.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Also had to learn about UI rendering, dipped a bit into OpenGL, though I
        didn’t do as much as I wanted, I might do smth related to graphics
        next.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Hope anyone who uses it enjoys it &gt;.&lt;<br />
